# Public Sphere Influence Questionnaire

**Welcome!**

Thank you for contributing to this research on the health of public spheres in Lebanon and Tunisia. Your expert insights are central to this project, hosted at [publicspheres.org](https://www.publicspheres.org). Our goal is to refine an **Influence Score** that helps us understand which media content shapes public opinion the most.

We‚Äôll ask you to:
- Select your country (Lebanon or Tunisia)
- Submit media samples for the period **January 1 to March 31, 2025**
- Score each sample‚Äôs **Reach**, **Salience**, and **Discursiveness**, with explanations
- Suggest events that may have shaped public opinion during this period

Our working formula is:
> **Influence = Reach √ó Salience √ó Discursiveness**

We are media-type agnostic‚Äîso whether a radio interview or a viral TikTok is most influential, we let the data speak. You‚Äôll go through a few samples per media category (TV, radio, print, social media, etc.), then move to the next.

## üìç First, Select Your Country
Please choose the context you are submitting samples for:
- [ ] Lebanon
- [ ] Tunisia

This selection will route you through a country-specific path.

## Section 0: Salient Issues in Your Context
Before scoring individual samples, help us understand the **key public concerns** during this period. We will use these later to assess how well each media sample aligns with public concern.

**0.1 In your view, what were the most salient public issues in your country between Jan 1 and Mar 31, 2025?**
_(Please list 5‚Äì10 issues. These will guide the salience evaluation of all your samples.)_

**0.2 For each issue, please give a few words of explanation or context.**
_(Why was this issue important? What shaped its prominence during this time?)_

## üìà Section 2: Reach

**Definition:** *Reach* is the estimated audience size or exposure of the content. It reflects how many people likely saw, heard, or read it.

**2.1 Raw Reach (numerical):**
_(e.g., estimated viewers, listeners, likes, views, impressions)_

**2.2 Basis for this estimate:**
_(Ratings? YouTube views? Judgment? Social media analytics? Be specific.)_

**2.3 Normalized Reach Score (0‚Äì1):**
*Use a scale where 1 = one of the highest-reach media in your context, and 0 = negligible or unknown reach.*

**2.4 Notes on platform-specific amplification (optional):**
_(e.g., rebroadcasts, shares, algorithmic boost)_

---

## üî• Section 3: Salience

**Definition:** *Salience* refers to how closely this content aligns with the public concerns you listed earlier in Section 0.*

**3.1 Salience Score (0‚Äì1):**

**3.2 Which of your earlier-listed issues does this sample reflect?**
_(Select or type in from your own list)_

**3.3 Explanation:**
- In what way does this sample reflect or engage with one or more of those issues?
- Is this connection central, peripheral, or symbolic?

---

## üß† Section 4: Discursiveness (Persuasiveness)

**Definition:** *Discursiveness* refers to the content‚Äôs potential to change minds, spark critical engagement, or persuade. We assess this using three classical elements of persuasion: Logos (reason), Pathos (emotion), and Ethos (credibility).*

### 4.1 Logos (Logic & Reasoning)
**Score (0‚Äì1):**

**Prompt:**
- Does the sample make arguments or build reasoning?
- Are claims backed by evidence, causal explanation, or logical progression?
- Does it acknowledge other sides of the issue or challenge the audience to think?

### 4.2 Pathos (Emotion)
**Score (0‚Äì1):**

**Prompt:**
- Does this sample connect emotionally‚Äîthrough stories, moral language, or dramatic framing?
- Is there anger, empathy, fear, or inspiration driving the message?

### 4.3 Ethos (Credibility)
**Score (0‚Äì1):**

**Prompt:**
- Who is speaking? Do they hold public authority, social trust, or deep experience?
- Would the average person find the speaker persuasive based on their role, background, or public perception?

**4.4 Optional Reflection:**
- What, if anything, makes this sample especially persuasive in your view?
- What should we be watching for when analyzing discursiveness in your country?

---

## üîç Final Prompt (Per Researcher)
**Were there any major political, economic, cultural, or foreign policy events in your country between Jan 1 and Mar 31, 2025 that you believe significantly shifted public opinion‚Äîeven if they weren‚Äôt directly covered in media samples you submitted?**

_(Open-ended)_
